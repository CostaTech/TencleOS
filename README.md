# TencleOS
TencleOS is an operating system created in Python. 
It is important to install Python in order to start it.
To use it, simply create a folder called “user” in the folder where you downloaded and extracted the .zip file and enjoy your new operating system.
In order to play Flappy Bird, it is important that you create an “Immagini” folder where you downloaded and extracted the .zip file.
Then, place all .png files except “grass.png” in the images folder.
