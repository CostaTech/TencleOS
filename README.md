# TencleOS
TencleOS is an operating system created in Python. 
To start it, you need to install Python.
To use it, simply create a folder called “user” in the folder where you downloaded and extracted the .zip file and enjoy your new operating system.
To play Flappy Bird, you need to download pygame and create an “Images” folder in the folder where you downloaded and extracted the .zip file.
Then, place all .png files except “grass.png” in the images folder.
To play Minecraft, you need to download ursina. 
To download both pygame and ursina, go to the terminal and type pip install ursina and pip install pygame.
